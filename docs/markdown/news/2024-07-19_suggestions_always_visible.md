Many of you have requested a way for the top suggested guesses to always be visible, rather than having to click the Suggestions icon each time in the navigation bar. Now it is possible.

Navigate to the Settings menu and select the "Suggestions Visible" option. After engaging this option, the top suggested guesses will be revealed (as well as the count of the remaining possible solutions) beneath the keyboard. These buttons will remain visible until you deselect the option in the Settings menu.
