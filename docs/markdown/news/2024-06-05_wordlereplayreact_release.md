After building WordleReplay.com in early 2022 as my first true web development project (using [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)), I'm happy to announce I have a new version of WordleReplay.com that is built using [React](https://react.dev/).

It's not that the original WordleReplay.com was bad. In fact, by earlier this year **2,000+ people were coming to the site _every day_**. Seeing as I've learned a lot of frontend web development since then, I figured it was time to bring some higher quality and new features to these incredible users.

Here are some of the new features that come with the upgraded version:
* A much improved UI that scales better to different screen sizes
* Guesses are saved automatically
* Hard Mode
* Color blind mode
* View, filter, and delete your history
