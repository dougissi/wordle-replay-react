They finally did it. The New York Times launched their own [Wordle Archive](https://wordlearchive.com/). The initial version that launched was so full of full of advertisements that it was basically unusable. It also used _a ton_ of memory, enough that could slow a user's whole computer down. But they've cleaned it up since then, and I'm happy about that for the community. I'm sure they'll continue to improve it in the future.

Perhaps they'll even glean some inspiration from Wordle Replay!
