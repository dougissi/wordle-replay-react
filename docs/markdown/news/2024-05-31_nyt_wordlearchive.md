They finally did it. The New York Times launched their own [Wordle Archive](https://wordlearchive.com/). I'm both happy and sad to report that it's so full of full of advertisements that it's nearly unusable. It also used _a ton_ of memory, literally 1.3 GB, which is enough that could slow a user's whole computer down. Perhaps they'll improve it in the future.

Maybe they'll even glean some inspiration from WordleReplay.com?
