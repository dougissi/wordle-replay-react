## Summary

The original [Wordle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle) game only allows you to play the _current_ day's puzzle. If you miss yesterday's puzzle, you can't go back and play it again.

This site, WordleReplay.com, solves that problem and allows you to replay _any_ Wordle that's been published to date, from June 19, 2021 through today. This site also provides suggestions for your next guess, in case you get stuck and don't want to be thinking about your next guess all day.

WordleReplay.com was originally created by Doug Issichopoulos in late January 2022. It was substantially updated and converted to a [React app](https://react.dev/) in late May 2024. For more information about Doug, see his webpage at [dougissi.com](https://www.dougissi.com).


## How to Play

In all likelihood, you already know the rules of Wordle, but if not, you can reference the [Wordle Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle).

The home page (WordleReplay.com) is where all games are played, and if you navigate to any other page on the site (like this one), you can return to the game by clicking the "Play" link from the navigation menu. Any guesses you've submitted for a puzzle will be saved, so you don't have to worry about accidentally closing your tab in the middle of a game. But see below for more details on history.


## Playing Previous Puzzles

When you first navigate to WordleReplay.com, you will arrive at today's puzzle. If your tab stays open overnight, you will likely need to refresh the page at the start of the day to see the new day's puzzle appear.
