After you've solved a puzzle and arrive at the win screen, there are new options available to you.

1. Replay the current puzzle. Beware: your guesses for the current puzzle will be deleted.
2. Play the closest unsolved puzzle to the date you just solved. If playing on a desktop, simply pressing "Enter" automatically take you there.
